2. Exporting from Each Social Platform — Premium, Optimal Best Practices
WhatsApp

Reality: WhatsApp deletes all EXIF and compresses JPEGs.
Good news: Filenames carry exact timestamps.

Optimal workflow

Open a chat → Tap Export Chat → choose Media Included.

Export each important chat individually.

Extract everything.

Place all exported chats into a single PDR_Input folder.

PDR detects timestamps inside filenames → rebuilds true order.

Common Issues PDR Fixes

Images taken minutes apart but shuffled

Mixed device types (Android/iPhone)

Missing months/years due to phone changes

Duplicate media from forwarded messages

Messenger (Facebook Messenger)

Why this is better than random downloads:
Only the full "Download Your Information" export preserves message/media grouping.

Optimal workflow

Visit Facebook → Settings → “Download Your Information”.

Select JSON format and Media.

Download the export once ready.

Extract and merge all media folders into PDR_Input.

Run PDR — it reconstructs real chronology using filename + fallback patterns.

Telegram

Strength: Telegram generally preserves original quality.

Optimal workflow

Use Telegram Desktop → Export Data.

Select Photos, Videos, Documents, Voice Notes.

Export locally (not cloud-only).

Feed the exported folders into PDR.

Signal

Why Signal is unusually good:
Local backups include consistent filenames and folder structures.

Optimal workflow

Go to Signal Settings → Chats → Create Backup.

Extract backup.

Place images + videos into PDR_Input.

Run PDR.

Snapchat

What makes Snapchat difficult:
Snaps lose EXIF and rely on internal metadata that isn’t always included.

Optimal workflow

Visit Snapchat My Data → request an export.

Extract memories, videos, stories.

Place them in PDR_Input.

PDR will reconstruct using filename inference + event grouping.

TikTok

TikTok creators often export to rebuild content calendars.

Optimal workflow

Request Personal Data Export.

Extract photos, videos, drafts.

Add them to PDR_Input.

PDR sorts by filename + embed timestamps (for MP4s).

Instagram

Albums break apart — PDR fixes this.

Optimal workflow

Visit Instagram → “Download Your Information”.

Select JSON + Media.

Extract and place everything into PDR_Input.

PDR rebuilds chronology and detects album pairings when possible.

YouTube

Creators use PDR to align filming timelines across multiple cameras.

Optimal workflow

Use Takeout → YouTube or export via YouTube Studio.

Extract video files.

Run PDR to align clips by creation timestamps.

3. After PDR — Where Should Your Fixed Social Media Library Live?
Option A — Reupload to the cloud

Use Google Photos, iCloud, Amazon Photos, OneDrive, etc.

Option B — Keep a private creator archive

Use SSD + HDD + cloud backup (3-2-1 rule).

Option C — Build a master “Life Timeline”

Combine social exports + phone photos + camera archives.

4. Social App Pain Points — and How You Avoid Them
1. Missing EXIF

PDR uses filename inference + fallback metadata to rebuild chronology.

2. Compressed, low-quality images

Not fixable, but PDR keeps them placed correctly in the timeline.

3. Albums and groupings broken

PDR detects patterns and reconstructs context.

4. Mixed device timelines

PDR synchronises events across Android, iPhone, Windows, Mac, cloud exports.
