Agent Instruction: Create Affiliates & Partners Page with Smart Split Application Flow
Objective

Create a dedicated Affiliates & Partners page for the Photo Date Rescue website that supports two distinct application paths:

Affiliates (individuals/creators promoting PDR)

Partners (companies requesting to be recommended within the PDR ecosystem)

This page should be linked from the existing “Enquire about affiliate & partner options” button on the current Affiliates page.

Page Structure
1. Page Header

Title:

Affiliates & Partners

Intro copy (calm, premium, non-salesy):

Photo Date Rescue works with a small number of trusted affiliates and carefully selected partners.
Choose the option that best fits how you’d like to work with us.

2. Initial Split (Required – First Interaction)

Present two clear cards or buttons:

Become an Affiliate
Earn commission by promoting Photo Date Rescue.

Partner / Recommend Your Product
Have a product or service that complements Photo Date Rescue? Apply to be considered.

Selecting one reveals a different form path (do not mix questions).

Affiliate Application Flow (Path A)

Purpose: Filter for genuine promoters with reach and relevance.

 only.

Optional (Not for v1, but allow future extension)
