2. Exporting from Each Cloud — Premium, Optimal Best Practices
Google Photos (via Google Takeout)

Best for: Anyone who has ever used Google Photos, Android backups, or Gmail-linked accounts.

Why this method is essential

Only Google Takeout includes JSON sidecars — these hold the original timestamps, camera info, and hidden metadata PDR uses to rebuild your correct timeline.

Standard “Download” does not include this.

How to export (best practice)

Go to Google Takeout.

Select Google Photos only.

Ensure JSON metadata is enabled.

Export as 2–50GB chunks (smaller chunks = fewer corrupt downloads).

Download all ZIPs.

Extract every ZIP into a single folder named PDR_Input.

Pain points eliminated by doing this correctly

Wrong “Date Taken”

Split Live Photos

Duplicated images

Scrambled folder order

Old JSON mismatches

iCloud / Apple Photos

Best for: iPhone owners, Mac users, families with shared Apple accounts.

Why “Unmodified Original” matters

It preserves:

HEIC

MOV

Live Photo pairing

Original EXIF timestamps

Apple-specific metadata

Optimal export workflow

On Mac:

Open Apple Photos

Select your entire library

Click File → Export → Export Unmodified Original

Tick “Export IPTC as XMP” if available

Export to a local drive folder

Feed the exported folder into PDR

On iCloud.com:

Use the “Download unmodified originals” option where available.

Avoid bulk web downloads for very large libraries; the Mac app handles them far better.

OneDrive
Why OneDrive works well with PDR

Keeps files structured

Preserves timestamps reliably

Handles huge libraries if synced locally

Optimal workflow

Install the OneDrive desktop client

Sync your Pictures folder locally

Once sync completes, drag the local copy into PDR

Avoid “Download as ZIP” if your library is over ~4GB.

Dropbox
Strengths

Very stable syncing

Excellent for mixed-device families

Good for professional workflows

Optimal export workflow

Install Dropbox desktop app

Allow full folder sync

Copy synced folder → PDR Input

Avoid huge “Download as ZIP” jobs — Dropbox intentionally limits this.

Facebook / Instagram / X / YouTube
Reality check

Exports from social apps often contain:

Compressed images

Stripped EXIF

No original resolution

No original timestamps

But PDR can still restore order and rebuild a usable timeline.

Best workflow

Use the “Download Your Information” tool

Select Photos & Videos (or channel exports for YouTube)

Extract everything

Place into your PDR Input folder

Expect metadata gaps — PDR fills these with filename inference + fallback logic

3. After PDR — Where Should Your Fixed Library Live?

Your new timeline is flawless, so treat it properly.

Step 1 — Create a Master Library

Store your PDR output in:

A local SSD,

A NAS,

Or a high-capacity external drive.

This is the single source of truth.

Step 2 — Optionally re-upload to the cloud
Option A — Clean reset in same Google Photos account

Export everything

Run PDR

Delete originals from Google Photos

Re-upload fixed images

Albums must be recreated manually

Option B — Use a fresh cloud account

Keeps personal chaos separate from your newly curated timeline.

Option C — Move to another provider

Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud — all become clean “views” of your library.

Step 3 — Never mix old cloud syncs with PDR output

Avoid having multiple sync clients write into your master folder. That’s how re-corruption begins.

4. Common Cloud Export Pain Points — and How You Avoid Them
1. Missing metadata

Solved by choosing the correct export method for each platform.

2. Massive ZIP files failing

Use desktop sync clients for OneDrive/Dropbox, and smaller chunk sizes for Google Takeout.

3. Duplicate or fragmented libraries

PDR recognises patterns and rebuilds continuity.

4. “My upload dates are wrong”

Cloud services show “Upload date” separately from “Date Taken” — the latter is now perfect thanks to PDR.
