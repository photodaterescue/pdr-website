2. Exporting from Each Device Type — Premium, Optimal Best Practices
iPhone / iPad

Best for:
Uncompressed originals, Live Photo pairs, HEIC + MOV pairing, and rich EXIF metadata.

Optimal Workflow (Mac)

Connect your iPhone/iPad via USB.

Open Finder → Locations → [Your Device].

Enter the DCIM folder.

Copy all subfolders into a master folder (e.g., PDR_Input/iPhone_2020_2024).

Ensure Live Photo .HEIC and .MOV pairs remain together.

Optimal Workflow (Windows)

Connect iPhone and trust the device.

Open This PC → Apple iPhone → Internal Storage → DCIM.

Copy all folders without renaming.

Avoid importing through third-party apps — they often strip EXIF.

Why PDR works here:
iPhone preserves original timestamps perfectly. PDR simply reaffirms these dates and renames files into your new clean universal format.

Android Phones

Best for:
Camera folders, screenshots, WhatsApp camera photos, and app-specific albums.

Optimal Workflow

Connect via USB and set the phone to File Transfer (MTP) mode.

Copy the following folders:

DCIM/Camera

DCIM/Screenshots

Pictures/*

Any app-specific camera folders

Do not mix with Google Photos “Saved” copies — those are recompressed duplicates.

Place the originals into your PDR Input folder.

Why PDR works here:
Android filenames often contain embedded timestamps (IMG_20200614_142300.jpg), which PDR reads and confirms against EXIF.

Digital Cameras (DSLR / Mirrorless)

Best for:
RAW files, JPEG + RAW pairs, burst sets, and the cleanest EXIF metadata.

Optimal Workflow

Remove the SD card.

Copy the entire card structure — not just the DCIM folder.

Keep RAW files (PDR reads their timestamps even if not editing them).

Do not rename or reorganise until after PDR.

Why PDR works here:
Cameras store the purest metadata. PDR can rebuild flawless timelines with almost no inference needed.

Legacy Devices & Old Backups

Best for:
Recovering forgotten photos from early smartphones, old laptops, and mixed-generation drives.

Optimal Workflow

Search old drives for folders named:

DCIM

Camera

Photos

100MEDIA, 101APPLE, Nikon, Canon

Copy everything into a single folder for PDR processing.

Do not reorganise — PDR will deduplicate and restore order.

Why PDR works here:
Even if modified dates are wrong, EXIF usually survives. When EXIF is missing, PDR falls back to filename logic or contextual inference.

3. After PDR — How to Store and Structure Your Hardware Archive

Hardware-sourced photos are often higher quality and deserve prioritisation.

Recommended Folder Structure
/My Photo Library
    /Camera Originals (High Res)
        /iPhone 2015–2020
        /iPhone 2020–2024
        /Canon 5D Archive
        /Sony Mirrorless RAW
    /Social Media (Low Res)
    /Screenshots
    /Scans & Prints

Best Practices

Keep RAW files separate — they don’t need renaming.

Keep high-resolution lenses grouped (Canon, Sony, Nikon).

Store these on your fastest drive or NAS for long-term archiving.

Never re-sync these originals into cloud services that may modify them.

4. Common Hardware Export Pain Points — And How You Avoid Them
1. “My photos have today’s date”

Windows sometimes rewrites Modified Date during copy.
PDR fixes this using EXIF.

2. Mixed folders and duplicates

Old phone migrations create copies everywhere.
PDR normalises and deduplicates automatically.

3. RAW files not handled by other tools

PDR doesn’t edit RAW, but it does read timestamps so your timeline stays chronological.

4. Burst modes and Live Photos split apart

PDR detects bursts + Live Photos, keeping sequences correctly ordered.
