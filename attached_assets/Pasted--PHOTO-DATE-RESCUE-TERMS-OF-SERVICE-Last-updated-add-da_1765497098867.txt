⭐ PHOTO DATE RESCUE — TERMS OF SERVICE
Last updated: [add date]
Welcome to Photo Date Rescue (“PDR”, “we”, “our”, “us”).
 By accessing or using our software or website (photodaterescue.com), you agree to the following Terms.

1. What PDR Is
Photo Date Rescue is a software application designed to repair, organise, and rename photo and video metadata. The service includes:
a free demo (web-based),


a paid desktop application,


optional subscription plans (monthly or yearly),


an optional lifetime licence (available only after completing one full paid billing cycle).



2. User Responsibilities
Users:
are strongly advised to create a full backup of their photos before using the app.


must ensure they have the legal right to process any images,


must use the app responsibly and for lawful purposes,


must keep their licence key secure and private.


PDR is not responsible for accidental data loss caused by user error, corrupted files, unsupported formats, or unbacked-up data.

3. Software Licence Terms
When you purchase PDR, you receive a non-transferable, single-user licence.
 You may:
install and use the licence on multiple personal devices belonging to you,


request support via email if activation fails.


You may not:
share, sell, lend, or gift your licence to another person,


resell activation keys,


reverse engineer, copy, or distribute the software.


Unauthorised sharing or resale of licences may result in licence deactivation and may be pursued as a breach of intellectual property law.

4. Lifetime Licence Eligibility
The lifetime licence is only available after a user completes one full paid billing cycle (one full month or one full year).
 Early upgrades, bypassing the cycle, or using the free demo does not grant access.
This ensures customers fully test compatibility and workflow before long-term commitment.

5. Payments
All payments are processed securely through Lemon Squeezy (our merchant of record).
 You agree that:
Lemon Squeezy handles billing, receipts, and tax collection.


Prices are listed in the currency shown at checkout.


No VAT is applied unless the company becomes VAT-registered (currently not VAT registered).



6. Refund Policy
Refunds are governed by our separate Refund Policy, which forms part of these Terms.

7. Limitation of Liability
Our software is provided “as is”.
 To the fullest extent permitted by law, PDR is not liable for:
loss of data,


indirect or incidental damages,


corrupted or unsupported files.


Users must maintain personal backups and test the demo before purchasing.

8. Marketing Consent
If a user consents to marketing during checkout, PDR may contact them about updates, offers, or new products.
 Without consent, communications will be strictly limited to transactional emails (orders, receipts, support).

9. Contact
For support or legal enquiries:
 admin@photodaterescue.com

10. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by UK law.

⭐ PHOTO DATE RESCUE — REFUND POLICY
Last updated: 11th of December 2025

2. Valid Reasons for Refund
A refund may be approved if:
the software fails to function as advertised,


we cannot resolve a technical issue after support attempts,


the activation system fails and cannot be restored.


3. Not Eligible for Refund
Refunds will not be issued for:
user error,


unsupported file types,


lack of backups resulting in data loss,


dissatisfaction based on results after full processing (demo exists for testing),


attempting to misuse licences or circumvent the lifetime eligibility rule.


4. How to Request a Refund
