2. Best Practices for Scanning — Premium, Optimal Workflows
Loose Prints

Best for: High-quality preservation of individual photos.

Optimal Workflow

Clean scanner glass; dust the prints lightly.

Scan at 600 DPI (don’t go lower; 300 DPI loses detail permanently).

Save as TIFF or high-quality JPEG.

Name files by approximate date or batch (e.g., Prints_1990s_001).

Place scans into a folder named Scans_YYYYs or Scans_Era.

Why PDR works here:
Scanned filenames and folder names guide PDR’s year inference; internal grouping restores multi-year collections smoothly.

Albums (Sticky Albums, Pocket Albums)

Best for: Preserving the album’s original storytelling.

Optimal Workflow

Scan whole pages first — not individual photos.

Save page scans in album order.

Optionally crop individual photos after PDR restores sequencing.

Keep album-name folders (e.g., Mums_Album_1980s).

Why PDR works here:
Album order acts as a timeline proxy. PDR preserves sequencing even when individual image metadata is missing.

Negatives & Slides

Best for: Maximum archival quality.

Optimal Workflow

Use a dedicated film scanner (Epson V600+, Plustek 8200i, etc.).

Scan at 2400–4000 DPI.

Save in TIFF or 48-bit RAW if supported.

Avoid colour auto-correction unless calibrated.

Preserve reel order — it is often chronological.

Why PDR works here:
Scan order + folder grouping gives PDR strong clues; RAW timestamps help with batch ordering.

Bulk Shoebox Projects

Best for: Very large, mixed-era family collections.

Optimal Workflow

Use a sheet-fed scanner OR a scanning service.

Scan in batches labeled roughly by decade (e.g., Shoebox_1970s, Shoebox_1980s).

Keep scans in the order they were fed.

Avoid renaming individual files.

Why PDR works here:
PDR uses filename ordering and batch grouping to reconstruct rough chronological sequences — without forcing manual date inputs.

3. After PDR — How to Store & Structure Your Scanned Archive

Scanning may lack EXIF data, but correct structure still creates a clean, intuitive archive.

Recommended Folder Structure
/My Photo Library
   /Camera Originals (High Res)
   /Scans & Prints
       /Albums – 1970s
       /Loose Prints – 1980s
       /Slides – 1990s
       /Shoebox Projects
   /Social Media (Low Res)
   /Screenshots

Best Practices

Keep scans separate from camera originals — different resolution tiers.

Maintain album grouping to preserve historical storytelling.

Store scans on a fast SSD or NAS, not on cloud-only storage.

Never re-scan “fixed” images — keep your raw scans safe.

4. Common Scan-Related Pain Points — And How PDR Solves Them
1. “My scans have no dates.”

Correct — scanners don’t embed EXIF. PDR infers dates from filenames, folder clues, and batch order.

2. “Everything appears out of order.”

PDR restores sequencing using filename sorting + contextual grouping.

3. “Resolution is inconsistent.”

Some scans come from services, others from home scanners. PDR does not scale resolution but retains order.

4. “I have duplicates from multiple scan jobs.”

PDR deduplicates using perceptual hashing.
