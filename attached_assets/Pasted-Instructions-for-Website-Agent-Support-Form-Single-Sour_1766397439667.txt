Instructions for Website Agent – Support Form (Single Source of Truth)
Objective

Create one unified Support page + form on the Photo Date Rescue website that:

Works for website visitors and desktop app users

Replaces all mailto links

Captures where the user came from (web vs app) without asking them

Keeps support volume structured and manageable

1. Create / Update Support Page

URL (canonical):

https://www.photodaterescue.com/support


This page will be the only support entry point used by:

Website menu → Support

In-app “Contact Support” button

Any future links (email footers, docs, etc.)

2. Build a Web-Based Support Form (NOT mailto)
Visible fields (keep it minimal):

Email (required)

Message (required)

Optional dropdown:

“What is this about?”

App not launching

Fix crashed / stopped

License issue

Something else

No file upload for now (keeps noise down).

3. Hidden Tracking Fields (Critical)

Add hidden inputs that auto-populate:

source        = web | app
app_version   = x.x.x (if present)
os            = windows | mac | unknown
page_referrer = document.referrer
timestamp     = submission time

Logic:

Default source = web

If URL contains ?source=app → override to app

If additional params exist, capture them silently

Example desktop app link:

https://www.photodaterescue.com/support?source=app&app_version=1.0.0&os=windows

4. Pre-Form Guardrail (Noise Reduction)

Above the form, include a short guidance block:

Before contacting support
Most setup, planning, and “is this normal?” questions are answered faster in the Guides.

Include links:

https://www.photodaterescue.com/guides

https://www.photodaterescue.com/guides/cloud-services

https://www.photodaterescue.com/guides/social-apps

https://www.photodaterescue.com/guides/hardware-devices

This subconsciously diverts low-value tickets.

5. Submission Handling

On submit:

Send to one inbox only (no CC chaos)

Include hidden field values in the message body

Subject line format:

[PDR Support] source=app | license issue


Confirmation message (important):

Thanks — your message has been received.
If this is a setup or planning question, you may get a faster answer via the Guides.

No auto-reply essay.

6. Replace Existing Mail Links

Remove or replace:

Any mailto: links

Any button that opens an email client

All “Contact support” buttons must:

→ /support

7. Test Cases (Must Pass)

Agent should test:

Website menu → Support → form submits (source = web)

Direct link with ?source=app → form submits (source = app)

Form works on desktop + mobile

No email client opens anywhere

Why This Matters (for the agent)

One form = one workflow

Hidden metadata = no back-and-forth

Guides reduce support load

Desktop app stays clean (no embedded support UI needed)
