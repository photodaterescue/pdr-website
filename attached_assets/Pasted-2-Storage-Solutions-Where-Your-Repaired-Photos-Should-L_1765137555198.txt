2. Storage Solutions — Where Your Repaired Photos Should Live
A. Cloud Storage (Easiest to use)

Recommended for small → medium libraries.

Google One

iCloud+

Microsoft OneDrive

Amazon Photos

Strengths: auto-sync, easy sharing, built-in AI search.
Weakness: expensive at high TB sizes.

B. External Drives (Best price per TB)

Perfect for home users with 20–200k photos.

Samsung T7/T9 SSDs

WD My Passport Ultra

Seagate Expansion Desktop (8–16 TB)

Strengths: fast, affordable, easy.
Weakness: single point of failure → must be backed up.

C. NAS Systems (For huge libraries)

For users with 100k+, or anyone preserving family history long-term.

Synology DS220+ / DS923+

QNAP TS-230 / TS-462

Strengths: RAID protection, centralised library, remote access.
Weakness: higher upfront cost.

3. Backup Strategy — The Premium Optimal Rule (3–2–1)

Your restored library should never be in only one place.

3 copies
2 different types of storage
1 off-site (cloud or NAS)

NAS + external SSD + cloud

2× external drives + cloud

Cloud + NAS + Google Takeout export
